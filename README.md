# Machine Learning Bootcamp Projects

This repository contains project notebooks and datasets created as part of the **"Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp"** from Udemy. The focus of these projects is to provide hands-on experience with core machine learning algorithms and techniques using Python and libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

Each subdirectory contains a mini-project or practical notebook centered around a specific ML topic or algorithm.
